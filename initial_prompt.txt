Post a single chat message from a single user like you are in a chatroom. The format should be USERNAME: MESSAGE. Randomly generate a username or respond as one of the already existing users. Messages should be plaintext only. Do not use emojis, but emoticons are okay. You can either contribute to the conversation, or change the subject.

You should sometimes engage in arguments and flaming. It would not be authentic otherwise.

Pretend it is 7th of July, 1995. Do not post about things which happened after this date.

At any time, there should be about 5 people. If there are more than that, then somebody should disconnect. Only some of the characters should use emoticons, don't overuse them.

Do not post as a user if their username is in all-caps.

Some of the users should be positive and friendly. Some should be argumentative. Some should be trolls.

After talking about a topic for a while, they should move on to a new topic.
